# Overview
SYS6/7 is a proprietary Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) framework created, owned, and maintained by Atlantean Technical Solutions Limited.
Development began in 2015, with production use and continuous improvement underway since 2016. Its aims are to get your system (or startup) 
from the drawing board and into production in days rather than weeks. Its philosophy is to keep things simple yet powerful, so that even 
a junior tech can be productive right away. 

# SYS6/7 provides the following enterprise features:

- RDBMS table templates
- DDL and view/form template generators
- Minimal class structure
- Intuitive logic flows
- FAST!
- Roles and access controls
- SQL and JS injection controls
- Clean Extensible module architecture (just add a module directory and you're all set)
- No ORM, just SQL and resultsets
- No routing - just call the subsystem, class and service you want
- No HTML templates (PHP is already a PHP template engine)
- Form and list JSON configuration
- Table sorting and pagination
- Validation framework
- Permissions and session management
- Auditing and logging infrastructure
- This repository exists to document the ownership, authorship, and licensing structure of the SYS6/7 platform.
- People, places, things and Operations straight out of the box
- Optional prebuilt modules
